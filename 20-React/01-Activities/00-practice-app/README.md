# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# 🐛 App Renders a Blank Page

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* As a user, I want to be able to see something rendered to the page when I visit the site.

## Expected Behavior

The page should render an `h1` heading tag that introduces the creator; for example, `<h1>Hello! My name is <insert name here></h1>`.

There should also be an unordered list of interests following the heading.

## Actual Behavior

The page loads with errors in the console and the page is empty.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

Because this is a new activity, we need to swap out the `/src` folder. Follow these steps to reproduce the problem:

1. Delete the `/src` folder in [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

2. Copy the `/src` folder from [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) and paste it into [00-practice-app](../00-practice-app/).

3. Run `npm start` and navigate to the page.

## 💡 Hints

Why do we need to import the React library in each component?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Why is it important to wrap all JSX tags for a single component in a single parent tag?
